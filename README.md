# DDoS
This is a small thing I made in spare time, it just is a nice ddos attack hub that uses other scripts and has Layer 3, Layer 4, and Layer 7 attacks. 
 
This also plays some of my fav songs to make it seem a bit cooler, if you don't like them than just learn python and delete it yourself.
 
Another thing this does is it opens websites.
 
This thing uses other peoples code, while I won't link the resp because I am lazy I will say, thank you to thefatrat and tokyomachiene and exyl for these cool songs!!
 
Usage: Clone the script, cd to the script, and "python3 Python.py".
 
 V2:
 
  
  I LEARNED THREADING!!!
   
  Now it plays song while starting, it also has a thankyou audio msg.
   
  Also new usage: python3 Thread.py
